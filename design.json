Use bold typography, asymmetrical grid layouts, overlapping elements, and unique color palettes. Incorporate subtle animations (parallax scrolling, smooth transitions, hover effects, micro-interactions) to make the site feel alive. Hero sections should have striking visualsâ€”gradient shifts, moving shapes, or interactive backgrounds. Take inspiration from award-winning sites on Awwwards, Behance, and Dribbble. Ensure the design has a strong visual identity, creative navigation elements, and cohesive branding across all pages. Prioritize originality, visual storytelling, and user engagement while keeping the experience clean and intuitive.",
